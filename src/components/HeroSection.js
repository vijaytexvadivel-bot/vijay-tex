      Established in 2013 by Mr. Vadivel S. G., Vijay Tex began with 50 looms dedicated to producing a single, standard quality of 100% pure grey cotton fabric. Through the founderâ€™s diligent leadership and hard work, we have scaled our operations to over 500 looms, enabling us to consistently deliver multiple premium qualities of 100% cotton fabric today. Our scale allows us to achieve a total weekly production capacity exceeding 250,000 meters across all our qualities.
